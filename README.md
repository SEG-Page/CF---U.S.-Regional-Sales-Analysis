# CF-U.S.-Regional-Sales-Analysis
This is a sales analysis for a fictitious company in the U.S. This is part of CF Achievement 6 project. 
# Data Sourcing: 
The data is an external data retrieved from Data.World (https://data.world/dataman-udit/us-regional-sales-data). The data is fictitious sales data for a retail company across various US regions. Data was created in 2021 by Udit Kumar Chatterjee (https://data.world/dataman-udit). Because this is a fictitious data, it can be trustworthy for project purposes. 
# Data Collection
This is administrative data as the company collects information about its operations. It includes data for routine operations and it is used to assess how well the company is achieving their goals.  
The data is generated through enterprise software system (if it were a real company) where the company houses their sales transactions in the United States. 
# Data Contents
The data contains US regional sales and it is categorized by region, customers, sales channels, orders, order dates/ship/delivery dates, and sales reps. 
# Limitations: 
The data is fictitious and therefore, the results may or may not represent sales for a real company. It would have been better to have data for a real company.
Data is prone to errors such as human or machine errors. It’s possible that company representatives may not enter the correct data and therefore, there could be duplicate records.  
# Data Relevance: 
The data is relevant for this project, as it has categorical, continuous, and regional data, which meets the project brief criteria. 

# Why did I choose this data?
I chose this data because it took me a couple of days and several hours to find a data that met the project brief’s criteria. While there were several data available, some did not include regions, dates, or it did not have enough records. 

This data met all the requirements and while it is fictitious, I like to analyze sales data because you can learn a lot about the performance of a company.
